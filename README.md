## 🤖 AI Agent Ecosystem

MedFlow AI leverages a sophisticated `ai-agent` edge function (implemented with Claude 3.5 Sonnet) that powers specialized behavior for each role:

- **Clinical Agent**: Assists doctors with SOAP note generation, patient briefings, and diagnostic suggestions.
- **Patient Agent**: Provides 24/7 symptom triage, medication reminders, and general health question answering.
- **Admin Agent**: Analyzes hospital data for predictive discharge trends and resource optimization.
- **Family Agent**: Translates complex medical jargon into plain language for clear family updates.
